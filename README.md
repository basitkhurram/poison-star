This is a demo of an Android port of Atari's game
Asteroids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29).

All graphics and audio effects are original work.

It happens that this is my first time using Java and also
first time developing for Android. As I continue to learn
more about Java (enrolled in a OOP Java class as of this
writing), I will refactor and improve this code.

Known bugs / upcoming changes:

Accelerometer steering requires correct calibration;

App fails to release memory when paused;

App resets game state upon resume;


Story mode to be added.
